# HW3A Solution- Git and Version Control

## Part 1: Repository Cloning

I successfully cloned the class repository from `https://github.com/olearydj/INSY6500` to
`~/insy6500/class_repo`

### Key Commands Used

-`git clone <url>` - Create local copy of remote repository
-`git log` - View commit history
-`git remote-v` - Check remote repository connections
 
## Part 2: Portfolio Repository Creation

I created my personal course repository with:
-Professional README.md describing the project
-Proper .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files
-Organized directory structure for homework, projects, and notes

### Understanding Git Workflow

The three-stage workflow:

 1. Working Directory: Where I edit files
 2. Staging Area: Where I prepare commits with `git add`
 3. Repository: Where commits are permanently stored with `git commit`

## Part 3: GitHub Publishing

Successfully published repository to GitHub:
-Used `git remote add origin` to connect local repo to GitHub
-Used `git push-u origin main` to upload commits
-Verified all files and commits are visible on GitHub
 
### The Remote Connection
My local repository is now connected to GitHub:
-`git remote-v` shows the remote URL
-`git push` will send my commits to GitHub
-`git pull` will get updates from GitHub (if changes are made on GitHub)
